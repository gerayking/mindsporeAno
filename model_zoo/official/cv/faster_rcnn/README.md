# FasterRcnn Example
 
## Description
 
FasterRcnn is a two-stage target detection network,This network uses a region proposal network (RPN), which can share the convolution features of the whole image with the detection network, so that the calculation of region proposal is almost cost free. The whole network further combines RPN and FastRcnn into a network by sharing the convolution features.

## Requirements

- Install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en).

- Download the dataset COCO2017.

- We use coco2017 as training dataset in this example by default, and you can also use your own datasets.

    1. If coco dataset is used. **Select dataset to coco when run script.**
        Install Cython and pycocotool, and you can also install mmcv to process data.

        ```
        pip install Cython

        pip install pycocotools

        pip install mmcv
        ```
        And change the COCO_ROOT and other settings you need in `config.py`. The directory structure is as follows:


        ```
        .
        └─cocodataset
          ├─annotations
            ├─instance_train2017.json
            └─instance_val2017.json
          ├─val2017
          └─train2017
    
        ```

    2. If your own dataset is used. **Select dataset to other when run script.**
        Organize the dataset infomation into a TXT file, each row in the file is as follows:

        ```
        train2017/0000001.jpg 0,259,401,459,7 35,28,324,201,2 0,30,59,80,2
        ```

        Each row is an image annotation which split by space, the first column is a relative path of image, the others are box and class infomations of the format [xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,class]. We read image from an image path joined by the `IMAGE_DIR`(dataset directory) and the relative path in `ANNO_PATH`(the TXT file path), `IMAGE_DIR` and `ANNO_PATH` are setting in `config.py`.

## Running the example

### Train
 
#### Usage

```
# distributed training
sh run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [PRETRAINED_MODEL]
 
# standalone training
sh run_standalone_train.sh [PRETRAINED_MODEL]
```
 
> Rank_table.json which is specified by RANK_TABLE_FILE is needed when you are running a distribute task. You can generate it by using the [hccl_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/utils/hccl_tools).
> As for PRETRAINED_MODEL，it should be a ResNet50 checkpoint that trained over ImageNet2012. Ready-made pretrained_models are not available now. Stay tuned.

#### Result
 
Training result will be stored in the example path, whose folder name begins with "train" or "train_parallel". You can find checkpoint file together with result like the followings in loss.log.
